# ARB Manager - VSCode Plugin

_Extract Strings, View ARBs in Table and more..._

The **ARB Manager Plugin** helps the management of ARB (Application Resource Bundle) files, enabling developers to manage ARB files within a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features

### 1. Extract Hardcoded Strings to ARB Files

- Right-click any hardcoded text in your codebase and select **Extract String to ARB File**. It will replace the hardcoded string with l10n.your_entered_key, define l10n according to your project tech stack in a variable.

For example, in Flutter project if you are using `flutter_localizations` from flutter SDK, you can defineâ€”

```dart
final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context);
```

Or you can make a build context extension to make it more cleaner. ðŸ˜‰

- On first use, locate your ARB files in the project folder. Use naming conventions like `app_en.arb` or `en.arb` for automatic locale detection.

</p>

Note: Translation doesn't occur automatically, you have to replace the strings manually follwoing your business requirement, auto translate may lead wrong translate, but we have a plan to add a flag if user wants auto translate in future.

** If you face issues with locating wrong arb folder or later at some point you decided to move ARB files on a different location, use `cmd` + `shift` + `p` and type `Clear ARB Folder Path` and try again to extract string, it will ask you again to select the correct ARB folder location.

### 2. View and Edit Translations

- Display all ARB files in a tabular format.
- Edit translations directly within the table.
- Highlight missing translations for easy identification.

</p>

### 3. Add New Translation Keys

- Add new keys dynamically, ensuring key uniqueness.
- Missing translations are highlighted automatically.

### 4. Import and Export Translations

- Import translations from a CSV file.
- Export current translations to a CSV file for external editing or backup.
